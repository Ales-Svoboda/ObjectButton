 *
 * The latest development version is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jsc-electronics/ObjectButton).

/**
 * @example ToggleLedOnClick.ino
 *
 * This sketch demonstrates using ObjectButton library with single button,
 * which will turn built-in LED on or off after being clicked.
 */

/**
 * @example ToggleLedOnDoubleClick.ino
 *
 * This sketch demonstrates using ObjectButton library with single button,
 * which will turn built-in LED on or off after being double-clicked.
 */

/**
 * @example ToggleLedOnDoubleClickWithInterrupt.ino
 *
 * This sketch demonstrates using ObjectButton library with single button,
 * which will turn built-in LED on or off after being double-clicked.
 *
 * This example is almost identical to ToggleLedOnDoubleClick.ino, except
 * button state refresh is bound to interrupt.
 */

/**
 * @example TurnLedOnLongPress.ino
 *
 * This sketch demonstrates using ObjectButton library with single button,
 * which will turn built-in LED on when it's long pressed.
 */

/**
 * @example TwoButtons.ino
 *
 * This sketch demonstrates using ObjectButton library with two distinct buttons.
 *
 * In this example we receive all events produced by buttons and print
 * which event occurred on which button to the serial monitor.
 */

/**
 * @example BlinkMachine.ino
 *
 * A more complicated blink state machine example.
 *
 * - Turn built-in LED on or off with a click gesture.
 * - Toggle built-in LED blinking between steady, slow and fast state with a double click gesture.
 *
 * This example is heavily inspired by a sketch from OneButton library:
 *
 * https://github.com/mathertel/OneButton/blob/master/examples/BlinkMachine/BlinkMachine.ino
 *
 * See their sketch for more details on internal workings, if it's not clear for your from this code.
